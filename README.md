## About me

My name is Sebastian and I did my B.Sc. in Germany in Economics & Computer Science.

I came to the USA in 2014 and worked for several years in IT consulting (mainly energy trading and insurance).
Now I am with Comcast as a 'Manager Software Engineering' within TPX (Stream/XfinityAPI).


I'm looking forward to deepen my understanding of how to evaluate and strucurally assess technology and architectural decisions.
I hope to gain insights in the latest research and trends on software architecutre from an academic perspective and how to apply it in the business world.
